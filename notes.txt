Note's from Danny's Blog API lecture for reference to set up the back end.

GOALS: 
API handles all crud functions

In our app user should be able to login, create account, home page (see all tasks), profile page (edit tasks, delete tasks, add tasks, assign tasks), admin page should also be able to edit, delete, add, assign, but also will have other admin features?
